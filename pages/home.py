                            There are several strategies that can be used, One of them is oversampling, that
                           involves increasing the size of the minority class by generating new samples, 
                           using for example SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) which creates new
                           synthetic samples based on existing ones.
                           In the other hand, undersampling, involves reducing the size of the majority class to 
                           balance the class distribution. This is achieved by randomly removing samples from the majority
                            class until the proportion between the classes is adjusted.
